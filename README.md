# Parametric-Surfaces-for-Graphical-Modelling

Modelling curves and human faces with parametric surfaces

## Problem 1

Use the interactive command line input to enter an integer scale factor by which the control points are scaled accordingly.

## Problem 4

Change the `level_of_detail` variable at the top of the `problem4.py` file to be one of the following options:

```
low - very few control points rendered
medium - normal amount of control points rendered
high - large amount of control points rendered (original model)
```
